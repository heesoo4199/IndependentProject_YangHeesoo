# IndependentProject_Template

This repository is for Heesoo's independent projects that were worked on during the 2nd year of Special Topics in Computer Science. The XAML and Web folders can be ignored, since those are just populating stubs. My first semester project (Arduino-powered quadcopter) can be found under the "Arduino" folder, and my second semester project (Unity Tetris) will go under the "Unity" folder (soon to be created as of 4/2/2018). My second semester learning-period project will be found under "Space Invaders" with a Mac executable (.app) build of the game and the source Unity project file.
